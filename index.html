<h3>the infinite canvas: <br> which narratives your feed is trying to tell you?</h3>
<div class="wrapper">
        <div class="typing-demo3">
      _this project is about 
    </div>
    <br>
 <div class="maintext">how imagery narratives have existed since before the creation of alphabets, and the way humans tell these narratives follows similar principles of sequential art. </div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="maintext">With the popularization of the web and social networks, most of these principles were used for social networks and sites that have some kind of feed.  </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="typing-demo">sites like Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter used</div>
    <div class="typing-demo2">some principles of narrative engagement to</div>
    <div class="typing-demo2">offer experiences on their main pages.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="maintext">However, this possibility of non-linearity and hypermedia for contents does not necessarily mean that the user has full control of what he consumes. As much as the contents are also published and consumed by ordinary users, </div> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="typing-demo">platforms can focus on prioritizing</div>
    <div class="typing-demo">the information they want, blocking</div>
    <div class="typing-demo2">posts and words without warning,</div>
    <div class="typing-demo2">and focusing on certain types of media overnight.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="maintext">This project is an analysis of digital typologies - such as feed prioritization, verified profiles, shapes of buttons - take advantage of hypernarrative principles to turn the user into an engaged spectator, often without the person wanting to or even noticing. </div>
       <br>

       <br>
        <div class="typing-demo3">
      _what is it for? 
    </div>
    <div class="maintext">Explore and point out which storytelling features social media feeds use to control which information is prioritized when someone uses them, and also:
    <ul><li>Proceed with an analysis of the narratives to be studied;</li>
    <li>Characterize the use of hyperlinks and multimedia on social networking platforms;</li>
        <li>Create models of the main typologies explaining how each one works;</li></ul></div>
            <div class="typing-demo3">
      _the methodology consist in 
    </div>
    <ul><li><div class="typing-demo">Bibliographic reviews: </div><div class="maintext">read again some texts read during the first semester; check other re-readings of ScottMcCloud's books, revisions and reiterations that he and others have made about his works; Search for more texts that talk about the subject, either demonstratively or critically;</div></li>

        <li><div class="maintext">Search for which narrative elements are used to engage the user;</div></li>

        <li><div class="maintext">Fit the different typologies of narratives into categories that are relevant: probably split into different categories of timelines, or into media forms (video, text, images, etc.);</div></li>

        <li><div class="maintext">Create links between excerpts of texts that are relevant and relate to the projects in some way, whether agreeing with what is said or making some kind of counterpoint;</div></li>

        <li><div class="maintext">Create a web platform that makes hyperlinks between these elements and texts, in a cohesive way;</div></li></ul>
